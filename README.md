* This project was employed to create ROM from CFD calculate data.
* The CFD calculate data should be placed in /AutoCFD/Workdata/
* The main code is "POD-Galerkin-Full.py"
* The project will create 3 .npz files to save the POD and Galerkin martix
* In "POD-Galerkin-Full.py" the interpolation method had been defined
* The evaluate.py file could be employed when the predicted result need to be cmpared with the CFD simulation result it will create three .png figure to compare veloctiy, temperature and concentration
* Any question please contact wenzhe_shang@tju.edu.cn
